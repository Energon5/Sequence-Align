Work in progress

Three elements currently finished. Seqextract.py allows for the extraction of a sequence from the solgenomics tomato database, emboss.py uses the
biopython libraries in order to do pairwise alignment via emboss NEEDLE command line, and xlsxextract.py allows for the extraction of a single
column from a csv file to get all accession numbers. xlsxextract.py will need to be incorporated with seqextract.py in order to retrieve all
of the sequences. This may prove to be difficult, due to needing to get a small amount of text with the sequence with the accession number.
